# Office-Automator

The application OfficeAutomator.py once connected to your raspberry pi will allow you to do 3 things. The first feature will allow a user 
to open up "morning tabs". Essentially this means that the current map of the ukraine crisis will open up along with local gas prices and todays top headlines.
The second feature will allow you to create a randomly generated email excusing you from work.
The third feature will allow you to simply and quickly open up excel to begin your work day.
